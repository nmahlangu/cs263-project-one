exploit-2a.py (exploits http.c:105)
- This exploit is overflowing a local buffer so just like in exploit-3.py, I could
  put my attack code in the buffer and overwrite the return address above %ebp to
  jump to the start of my attack code.

exploit-2b.py
- TODO

exploit-2c.py
- This exploit was actually used to generate exploit-3 so yes, it can definitely
  be used to hijack control flow of the webserver and unlink the specified file :)

exploit-2d.py
- This exploit is overflowing a local buffer so just like in exploit-3.py, I could
  put my attack code in the buffer and overwrite the return address above %ebp to
  jump to the start of my attack code.

exploit-2e.py
- This exploit is overflowing a local buffer so just like in exploit-3.py, I could
  put my attack code in the buffer and overwrite the return address above %ebp to
  jump to the start of my attack code.
