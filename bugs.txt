In zookd.c, the buffer reqpath is declared with size 2048 bytes. 
However, one can write past the end of this buffer by sending the
server a request like "GET /{long_path} HTTP/1.0" where {long_path}
is an unexpectedly long path. For example, in /bugs/1, run the
command "./bug1 s" for an example of what happens with a short
enough request. However, run "./bug1 l" which contains a path
with 5000 characters and causes the server to segmentation fault.

	url_decode(reqpath, sp1);
