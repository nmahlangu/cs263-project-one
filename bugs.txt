[http.c:105]
In zookd.c, the buffer reqpath is declared with size 2048 bytes. 
However, one can write past the end of this buffer by sending the
server a GET request where REQUEST-URI is greater than 2066 characters.

	url_decode(reqpath, sp1);

[http.c:159]
In the function http_request_headers, value is a buffer of size
512 bytes. However, one can write past the end of this buffer by
passing a header field with a value longer 535 characters.

	url_decode(value, sp);

[http.c:165]
In the function http_request_headers, envvar is a buffer of size
512 bytes. However, one can write past the end of this buffer by
passing a header field with a key that is unexpectedly long. A key
of 1043-1046 causes the server to return an empty response; 1047
will cause the server to hang; and 1048 will cause the server
to crash.

	sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf);
