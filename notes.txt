Web Server setup
----------------
- zookld, a laucher daemon that launches services configured in the file zook.conf
- zookd, a dispatcher that reroutes HTTP requests to corresponding services
	- listens on a port (default is 8080) for incoming HTTP requests and reads the first
	  line of each request for dispatching. here, zookd is configured to dispatch every
	  request to the zookfs service, which reads the rest of the request and generates
	  a response from the requested file.
- zookfs and other services that may server static files or execute dymanic scripts
- http.c: contains most HTTP-related code
- Use the clean-env.sh script - this uses the same stack and memory layout every time.
  This is the same way it'll be run during grading, so make sure all exploits work on
  configuration
- Reference binaries of zookws are provided in bin.tar.gz - we will use those binaries
  for grading, so make sure that your exploits work on those binaries
 
Version 1 of Web Server
----------------------
zook-exstack.conf
- configures zookld, zookd-exstack, zookfs-exstack
- *-exstack binaries have an executable stack, which makes it easier to inject executable code using
  stack buffer overflow. 

Version 2 of Web Server
----------------------
zook-nxstack.conf
- configures zookld, zookd-nxstack, zookfs-nxstack
- *-nxstack binaries have a non-executable stack; you will write exploits that bypass non-executable stack
  later in this lab assignment
