Web Server setup
----------------
- zookld, a laucher daemon that launches services configured in the file zook.conf
- zookd, a dispatcher that reroutes HTTP requests to corresponding services
	- listens on a port (default is 8080) for incoming HTTP requests and reads the first
	  line of each request for dispatching. here, zookd is configured to dispatch every
	  request to the zookfs service, which reads the rest of the request and generates
	  a response from the requested file.
- zookfs and other services that may server static files or execute dymanic scripts
- http.c: contains most HTTP-related code
